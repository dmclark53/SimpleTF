# SimpleTF

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks of simple TensorFlow models. Instead
of using public data sets, the focus here is to allow the user to create their
OWN data sets. This way the user can explore the relationship between different
data sets and the hyperparameters needed to fit the model.

## Logistic Regression
Create clusters of points. Classify the data according to what cluster it falls in.

## Wave Period Classifier
Create wave samples with a specific period, but a random amplitude. Using a 
recurrent neural network, classify each wave form by period.
